# library-scraper

A webscraper that gathers basic data on books in my library based on ISBNs collected from a phone scanner.
Very work in progress but I want the commit history for ifI make more sweeping structural changes.

Input will be a txt with an isbn on each line

output is a json file ready to import into mongodb.
